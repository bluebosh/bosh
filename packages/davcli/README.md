davcli package
============
This package is used for communicating with web dav blobstores

The blob compiled from [bosh-davcli](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/bosh-davcli)
and hosted in an [s3 bucket](https://s3.amazonaws.com/davcli/davcli-0.0.44-linux-amd64)

(see the [concourse resource](https://main.bosh-ci.cf-app.com/teams/bosh-director/pipelines/davcli/resources/release-bucket-linux))
